    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 prepared pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>20-30 slices pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven to heat up.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness. Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Arrange the pepperoni slices on top of the cheese.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the olive oil over the pizza and sprinkle with dried oregano. If you like a bit of heat, add crushed red pepper flakes as well.</li>
        <li>If using, sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese over the top for extra flavor.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or onto the pizza stone if using) and bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!</li>
