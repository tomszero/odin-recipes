    <h1>Lasagna</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 cups ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic until well browned. Add crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with eggs and 3/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
