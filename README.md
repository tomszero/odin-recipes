# Odin Recipes

A small static recipe webpage built to practice HTML and basic git workflows while following lessons from The Odin Project. The goal was to create a simple, functional recipe site and reinforce fundamentals (cloning, committing, and serving static pages).

## Features
- Simple, hand-written HTML pages for recipes with images
- Example recipe data in separate files for easy editing
- Intended as a learning exercise rather than a production site

## Getting started
Requirements:
- Git
- A web browser

Clone and run:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd odin-recipes
# Open the site in your browser:
# Open index.html directly
```

## Project structure
- README.md — this file
- index.html — main page / recipe list
- recipes/ — individual recipe fpages
- images/ — images and other media
  
Adjust paths and commands to fit your local setup.

## Reflection
This was really fufilling for me. Is a small project, but one more step in the direction I want to take in my learning journey. I'm very happy to have done this, and despite being so little, it feels huge. I'm glad I have taken this challenge, and most important of all, I'm enjoying it.
